How to Use SeeDream 4.0 to Generate and Edit Images
Here is a practical, step-by-step breakdown of how to use our platform's core functions.
This is the primary function for bringing your ideas to life.
- Step 1: On the homepage of www.seedream4ai.org, locate the main text input box (the "prompt box").
- Step 2: Write a detailed description of the image you envision. For best results, be specific about the subject, setting, style, and lighting.
  - Example: cinematic photo, a wise old librarian with glasses sitting in a vintage armchair, surrounded by towering bookshelves in a dimly lit library, warm light from a single lamp, hyper-detailed.
- Step 3: (Optional) Adjust advanced settings like aspect ratio (e.g., 1:1, 16:9) and select a predefined style (e.g., Anime, Photorealistic) to guide the AI.
- Step 4: Click the "Generate" button and watch your idea materialize in seconds.

Once you have an image, you can perfect it.
- To Use Inpainting (Erase & Replace):
  1. Select the "Erase" or "Inpaint" tool.
  2. Use your mouse to brush over the object or area you want to change.
  3. In the prompt box that appears, describe what you want to replace it with (e.g., a golden vase with flowers). Or, leave it blank to simply remove the object.
  4. Click "Generate" to see the magic happen.
- To Use Outpainting (Expand Canvas):
  1. Select the "Expand" or "Outpaint" tool.
  2. Drag the borders of the image frame outwards to create new, empty space.
  3. The AI will automatically analyze the existing image and generate a seamless extension that matches the scene.

Give your existing photos or art a new life.
- Step 1: Upload your image to the platform.
- Step 2: Write a text prompt that describes the new style or content you want to apply.
  - Example: If you upload a photo of your dog, your prompt could be a vibrant Pixar-style 3D render.
- Step 3: Adjust the "Image Strength" slider. A lower value gives the AI more creative freedom, while a higher value will adhere more closely to your original image's structure.
- Step 4: Click "Generate" to transform your image.

Pro Tips for Masterpiece Creation
- Be Descriptive: The more adjectives and details you use, the better the result.
- Use "Magic Words": Add terms like cinematic lighting, hyper-detailed, 4K, Unreal Engine, masterpiece to enhance quality.
- Iterate: Don't settle for the first result. Tweak your prompt and generate a few variations.
- Combine Tools: Generate an image, use Outpainting to expand the scene, and then use Inpainting to fix small details. This workflow gives you ultimate control.
